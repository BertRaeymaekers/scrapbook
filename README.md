*Use at your own risk*

Some random scripts.
Hacks I once wrote that might work.
Hardly maintained.
Attributes like *beautiful*, *pythonic*, ... don't apply to this code.
Not documented (if you're lucky there are comments in the code that *might* help).
Usually not parameterised so you'll need to dig in the code to make it somwhat useful.

Again I don't recommend using any of this: This is just a backup for myself that happens to be public.

## twiterage.py
**legacy Python**

Twitter bot that tweets when there are upcoming events.
Managed by direct messaging the account from whitelisted accounts.

## monitor.sh
**bash**

Simple script to see if websites has changed.
